		Primitive types:

		integral types:


		short sh=10;
		
		byte byte1=100;

		int num=sh;
		
		byte byte2=sh;

		short short1=num;

		byte b=200;
		
		
		by default, any intergral constant is a 32-bit int integer type.

		char ch=10;

		char ch1=-10

		Floating point types:

		float f=10.5;

		by default, any decimal literal is a 64 bit double type

		boolean b=0;
		boolean bool1=null;

		int num=null;

------------------Reference types:
1. arrays
2. String
3. Class


one dimensional:

int []arr={10};

int []arr={}

In java, string is not a type, it is a class

int,float,char

String: 
String is immutable: any String object cannot be modified.

--------------------------Object Oriented Programming----------------------------------

Bank :

Customer
Employee
Account
Loan
Schemes

1. Identify entities(Class)
Class: A class is a user defined type.
A class contains set of attributes which helps us in describing an object.

Class: Employee
attributes: employeeId,name,salary,designation,

Class:Transaction
transactionId, transactionDate,amount,type

Object: An object is an instance of class which represents the real world entity.


--------------Day2
this is keyword which represents the current object which has called the method.
this is only applied to instances of the class.
this simply means instance or object

Each class available or created in Java is always a child class of Object Class.
All the classes in Java(predefined,user-defined) have a parent which is Object class.

employee.equals(employee1)


---------------------Inheritance----------------------------

protected members are also accessible to non-child class within the same package.



Abstract classes:


Interface : like a class, interface is also a user-defined type.

We create a class to create a type and instantiate.

The purpose of an interface is to implement loose coupling.

interface allows to implment plug and play feature.


-----------------------------------Day3-----------------------

Collections APIs in Java.

collection of integer,characters,strings,object

Collection of integers: 10,20,30,40,50
Collection of characters: A,B,C,D
Collection of doubles: 10.5,6.5,8.5
Collection of strings: "John","Mark","James"..
Collection of object: emp1,emp2,emp3.....
Collection of booleans: true,true,false,false.....

API: set of classes and interfaces provided by Java.
  collection API:    java.util package


   Iterable 
  Generic: is used to write type-safe code.

  primitives cannot be used in collection APIs.

  for all primitive types, there is an equivalent classes available in Java , which are called Wrapper classes.

	int Integer
	char Character
	double Double
	float Float
	short Short
	byte  Byte
	boolean Boolean

---------------------------------------------Day4: Exception Handling ----------------------------------

Exceptions are errors which occurs at run-time and these errors are thrown by Runtime(JVM).

In Java, we can have either checked exceptions or unchecked exceptions.

checked expceptions: are the exception which can be identified by the compiler. The compiler tries to warn to that the code might throw exception at runtime.

If there is any checked exceptions, compiler will not allow you to enter Runtime Environment.

All the exceptions except RuntimeExceptions and its child are checked exception.

RuntimeException and its children exception classes are unchecked expcetion.

throw is a keyword which is used to explicitly throw an exception from the code.

-----------------------Java8 ------------------------------------------

Interfaces from Java8 onwards.
-- Default methods: 
Functional interface
